# PixelAscend: AI-Driven Image Super-Resolution

**Description:** PixelAscend leverages SRGAN deep learning to transform low-resolution images into crisp, high-resolution masterpieces. Explore AI-driven image enhancement with our source code and demo video for improved clarity and detail.

## Overview

This repository contains the core source code for our SRGAN model along with an output demonstration video. This project is designed for developers and enthusiasts who want to experiment with advanced deep learning techniques to enhance image quality.

## Features

- **SRGAN Model:** Implements a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network.
- **High-Quality Output:** Converts low-resolution images to high-resolution images.
- **Demo Video:** Includes an output video demonstrating the modelâ€™s performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies as listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
  - Examples include: TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV-Python, Matplotlib, SciPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-3119/PixelAscend.git
   cd PixelAscend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data:**  
   Place your low-resolution images in the designated folder if needed.

2. **Run the Model:**  
   Execute the ipynb file to perform super-resolution:
   ```PixelAscend.ipynb
   ```
   The model will process the images and generate high-resolution outputs.

3. **View the Output:**  
   Check the provided `output_video.mp4` for a demonstration of the enhanced images.
